# peek — threat model (DRAFT)

**Status:** stub. To be filled in before public Chrome Web Store submission
(Phase 5 launch gate). Existence-tracking only — the gap is intentionally
visible.

**Owner:** harry-harish.

This file enumerates the attack surfaces and existing / outstanding
mitigations for `@peekdev/extension`, `@peekdev/mcp`, and `@peekdev/cli`.
It is referenced from [`docs/PHASE_5_LAUNCH_PLAN.md`](../PHASE_5_LAUNCH_PLAN.md)
Gate A and from [`SECURITY.md`](../../SECURITY.md).

When this stub is replaced, follow the format described in the OSS
Maintenance Field Manual §5.3 — one surface per row in each table,
explicit grade (`mitigated` / `partial` / `accepted` / `open`), and a
"why we live with it" column for any accepted risk.

## Attack surfaces to cover

1. **Chrome MV3 service-worker compromise** — what happens if an attacker
   gets code into `background.ts`. Trust boundary: extension package
   itself.
2. **MAIN-world rrweb-recorder.js IIFE** — the IIFE runs in the page's
   own JS context (not extension isolated world) so a malicious page can
   read / overwrite its globals. Trust boundary: page → extension.
3. **`chrome.runtime.connectNative` stdio pipe** — between the extension
   and `peek-mcp --native-host`. JSON-on-stdio with a 4-byte framing
   header. Trust boundary: extension → native host.
4. **Native-messaging host registration** — `peek install-native-host`
   writes the registration JSON under the user's home directory. Trust
   boundary: CLI → OS user account.
5. **`chrome.debugger` (Deep capture)** — attaches the CDP debugger to
   the user's tab, can read response bodies. Trust boundary: extension
   → all browsing data on that tab.
6. **MCP server `execute_action` tool** — when wired to an AI client,
   the model can request side-effecting actions in the browser. Trust
   boundary: AI client → user's browser.
7. **`~/.peek/sessions.db` + `~/.peek/audit.log`** — SQLite + append-only
   log under the user's home directory; readable by the same OS user.
   Trust boundary: any process running as the user.
8. **Chrome Web Store update channel** — once published, CWS pushes
   updates to all installs. Trust boundary: Cubenest publisher account
   → all extension users.

## Mitigations already in place

Reference Phase 4a/c artifacts and ADRs. To be expanded inline once the
real threat model is written.

- ADR-0008: no `<all_urls>` in `host_permissions`; per-origin opt-in via
  `chrome.permissions.request({ origins })` at user-gesture time.
- ADR-0009: native-messaging stdio bridge (not localhost HTTP), avoids
  DNS-rebinding risk class.
- ADR-0010: five-level per-origin permission model; default Level 1
  (Observe only); destructive-action blocklist applies even at Level 4
  YOLO.
- `peek-extension/src/relay/mask.ts`: PII masking applied before any
  event leaves the page's content script.
- `peek-extension`: Deep-capture disable detaches `chrome.debugger`
  from every tab of the origin immediately (privacy fix task #51).
- `peek-mcp`: `execute_action` audit log at `~/.peek/audit.log` mode
  0600.
- `peek-cli`: `peek init` MCP wizard refuses to write to a config file
  the current user does not own (pre-init guard).

## Outstanding mitigations

- **Content-script isolation hardening** — the MAIN-world recorder IIFE
  is currently injected without `iframe` source-isolation. A malicious
  page can overwrite the IIFE's exported handle on `window`. Need to
  evaluate moving to a closure-only export + postMessage handshake.
  Pre-1.0 scope.
- **Native-host framing fuzz coverage** — the 4-byte length-prefix
  framing in `peek-mcp/src/native-host/stdio.ts` has unit tests for
  the happy paths but no negative-input fuzzer. Pre-1.0 scope.
- **CWS publisher 2FA recovery** — single-publisher (harry-harish);
  the Cubenest CWS console account needs documented 2FA recovery codes
  printed and stored offline. Tracked under
  [`docs/SUSTAINABILITY.md`](../SUSTAINABILITY.md) §"Named ownership".
- **CDP-debugger banner UX** — Chrome shows "extension started
  debugging this browser" when `chrome.debugger.attach()` is called;
  the toggle's confirmation copy needs a user-test pass to confirm the
  warning is unambiguous.
- **MCP `execute_action` schema versioning** — see deprecation policy
  in [`SUPPORTED.md`](../../SUPPORTED.md); needs an ADR locking in the
  "tool schemas never remove fields, only add" rule before 1.0.
